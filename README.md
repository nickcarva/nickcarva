## Hey there 👋

My name is Nicolas, I'm 18 and from Brazil 🇧🇷. I'm passionate about technology since my first experience with it.<br/>
I've been working as Fullstack Developer and Designer at [Cosmonific](https://www.cosmonific.com), which one I am also co-founder.

In september/2020, I've started working as Software Developer at ecovitas digital, a retailer company, from Curitiba - Paraná.

At my repositories, you can find some experiments with a little bit of everything that I've learning in my career until now.
